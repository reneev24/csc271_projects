<h2>What is ONE+ONE?</h2>
<meta name="keywords"
    content="making new friends"/>
<p>ONE+ONE is a platform that makes the procss of making new friends a simpler one whether it is<em>locally</em> or <em>internationally</em>. 
It helps to simplify the problem of finding and socializing with others as it brings <a href="explore.html">new possible connections</a>right to the user.
To quicken the process, ONE+ONE will put people that the user would more likely be interested in on the top their page.<br/>
One reason we're different from other platforms is our use of facial recongition. This will help prevent users from being

This will make it harder for individuals to disguise themselves as other people.</p>
