<h2>What is ONE+ONE?</h2>
<p>ONE+ONE is a platform that allows users to make connections with anyone <em>locally</em> or <em>internationally</em>. 
It helps to simplify the problem of finding and connecting with others as it brings people right to the user.
To quicken the process, ONE+ONE will put people that the user would more likely be interested in on the top their page.<br/>
One reason we're different from other platforms is our use of facial recongition. This will help prevent users from being

This will make it harder for individuals to disguise themselves as other people.</p>
